# PRD â€” Classic 8 Cleaning Website Redesign

## 1) Background

Classic 8 Cleaning's current website fails to reflect the company's 30-year legacy and corporate professionalism, creating a disconnect between their premium service quality and their digital presence. Property managers like Sofia Chen need to quickly assess vendor credibility through professional websites that demonstrate reliability, service scope, and industry expertise. This redesign addresses the Charter's core problem of helping commercial decision-makers find trusted cleaning partners by creating a digital experience that matches Classic 8's corporate discipline and service excellence. The timing is crucial as Michael seeks to modernize the business while preserving the traditional values that have built their reputation over three decades.

## 2) Objectives & Desired Outcomes

- Property managers can quickly assess Classic 8 Cleaning's credibility and service capabilities through a professionally designed website that reflects corporate standards and industry expertise
- Potential clients experience seamless consultation request processes with clear service information, transparent communication, and immediate confidence in Classic 8's ability to handle their specific property needs
- The website becomes a trusted resource that supports long-term relationship building by showcasing testimonials, case studies, and the depth of experience that property managers value when selecting cleaning partners
- Non-goals / Boundaries: This iteration focuses on corporate and institutional clients only, excluding residential services, and emphasizes professional consultation over instant online booking

## 3) Users & Stories

- **Primary Persona:** Sofia Chen (Corporate Property Manager)
  - Story A: As Sofia, I want to quickly evaluate Classic 8's expertise across different property types, so I can determine if they're suitable for my diverse portfolio before investing time in consultations.
  - Story B: As Sofia, I want to see detailed testimonials and case studies from similar properties, so I can build confidence in their ability to maintain the professional standards my tenants expect.
  - Story C: As Sofia, I want easy access to emergency contact information and service scope details, so I can present comprehensive vendor options to my property owners during contract decisions.

## 4) Key Feature

- **Professional Service Portfolio:** Comprehensive presentation of cleaning services organized by industry and property type, with clear descriptions of specialized approaches, equipment, and quality standards that demonstrate expertise to commercial decision-makers
- **Trust Building Content Hub:** Testimonials, case studies, and 30-year legacy storytelling that provides the credibility evidence property managers need to confidently recommend Classic 8 to building owners and management committees
- **Streamlined Consultation Process:** Clear consultation request system with property-specific intake forms that demonstrate Classic 8's understanding of commercial real estate while making it easy for busy property managers to initiate service relationships

## 5) Key Flow

  - **Path:** She browses service pages by industry, reviews testimonials from similar properties, and understands Classic 8's specialized approach to healthcare facility cleaning requirements
  - **Result:** Sofia feels confident in Classic 8's expertise and initiates consultation request with property-specific details

- **Example:** Emergency Service Discovery

## 6) Competitive Analysis

- **Landscape (who is solving this problem):** Large corporate cleaning chains like Jani-King and ServiceMaster provide standardized commercial services; regional cleaning companies offer local relationships; facility management companies provide integrated services; property managers could handle cleaning coordination internally
- **Value Thesis (each player's proposition):** Corporate chains offer scalability and brand recognition but lack personal relationships; regional companies provide local knowledge but may lack corporate systems; facility management companies offer integration but dilute cleaning expertise; internal management provides control but requires significant resource investment
- **Strengths / Weaknesses (experience pros/cons):** Large chains have polished marketing but impersonal service delivery; regional competitors often have basic websites that don't build confidence with corporate clients; facility management companies focus on integration over cleaning excellence; internal coordination creates operational burden for property managers
- **Our Differentiators (our unique points):** Classic 8 combines the corporate credibility and systematic processes that property managers expect with the personal relationships and adaptability that large chains cannot provide; our 30-year legacy demonstrates stability while our focus on commercial properties shows specialized expertise that generalist competitors lack
- **Switching Costs & Risks (migration costs and risks):** Property managers risk service disruption when changing vendors and need confidence that new partners understand their specific building requirements; decision-makers face professional risk if recommended vendors fail to meet tenant expectations or create operational problems
- **Notes (reference links):** Research competitor websites of Jani-King, ServiceMaster, and leading regional commercial cleaning services for corporate presentation standards and service communication approaches
