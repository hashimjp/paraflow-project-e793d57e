## About Sofia

Sofia manages a portfolio of 12-15 commercial properties including office towers, mixed-use developments, and professional medical buildings across the GTA. She's been in property management for over 10 years and has built her career on maintaining high occupancy rates and tenant satisfaction. She values long-term vendor relationships with companies that understand the commercial real estate business and can adapt to the specific needs of different property types. Sofia takes pride in being proactive rather than reactive, always looking for partners who share her commitment to excellence and professional standards.

## Behavioral Considerations

- Evaluates vendors based on track record, references, and their ability to handle multiple property types with consistent quality
- Prefers detailed service agreements and clear communication channels, expecting regular updates on service delivery and any issues
- Makes decisions collaboratively but is the primary influencer for service contracts, often presenting recommendations to building owners or management committees
- Responds well to vendors who demonstrate industry knowledge and can provide solutions before problems arise
- Values vendors who understand the importance of maintaining building aesthetics for tenant retention and property values

## Frustrations

- Cleaning companies that don't understand the difference between residential and commercial cleaning standards or the importance of professional appearance
- Vendors who require constant supervision or fail to communicate proactively about issues, maintenance needs, or service adjustments
- Services that create disruptions during business hours or fail to coordinate effectively with building security and maintenance schedules
- Companies that can't scale services appropriately when properties have special events, tenant moves, or seasonal cleaning requirements

## Goals

- Maintain consistently high standards across all properties to support tenant satisfaction and lease renewals
- Establish reliable partnerships with vendors who can grow with her portfolio and adapt to changing property needs
- Minimize emergency situations and reactive maintenance through proactive vendor relationships and preventive care programs
- Demonstrate value to property owners through cost-effective vendor management and superior building presentation

## Tasks

- Research and evaluate cleaning service providers for new properties or when current contracts expire
- Review service performance through regular property inspections and tenant feedback analysis
- Coordinate cleaning schedules with building operations, security teams, and tenant requirements
- Manage vendor contracts, performance reviews, and budget recommendations for property owners
- Handle emergency response coordination when properties require immediate cleaning or maintenance intervention
- Prepare vendor performance reports and recommendations for contract renewals or changes
